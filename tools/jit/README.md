# Standalone CTK JIT prototype

Build the local runner with LLVM and Clang 21 or newer, including their shared
development libraries. Then run the CLI from the repository's Python environment.

```sh
cmake -S tools/jit -B build/jit -G Ninja
cmake --build build/jit
uv sync --locked
uv run ctk-jit run query.ctk --file src/example.cpp --compdb build/
```

Use a compilation database with one entry for the target file. Prefer a
compilation database produced by a toolchain compatible with the linked Clang.
On macOS, use the matching Homebrew Clang when generating an entry with
`clang++ -MJ` so the entry uses flags understood by the runner.
The CLI accepts a database directory or the JSON file itself. Use `--runner`
for a native runner built outside `build/jit`.

Save this as `query.ctk` to print each explicit function definition in the
target source file.

```text
let tree = parse arg.file
let rows = match functionDecl(isDefinition(), isExpansionInMainFile(), unless(isImplicit())).bind("f") in tree
foreach row in rows do {
    print row.f.decl_name
}
```

The prototype supports one parse of `arg.file`, one bound `functionDecl` or
`cxxMethodDecl` match, and one projection of `decl_name` or `qualified_name`
per row. Supported predicates are `isDefinition`, `isExpansionInMainFile`,
`isImplicit`, `isConst` (methods), `hasName` with a literal, and `unless`.
The existing CTK parser feeds a local C++ generator. Clang Interpreter executes
the generated code against the local AST.

To exercise a custom matcher, pass a trusted `.cpp` file to `run`. Include
`<ctk/jit/runtime.hpp>` and define `void run(ctk::jit::RunContext &ctx)`.
Use `ctx.match(matcher, callback)` to traverse the target and
`ctx.emit_text(text)` to emit a line. The extension executes with the invoking
user's permissions.
